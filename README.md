# Harmonic Enrichment MIDI Dataset

This repository contains the MIDI files used for the study on harmonic enrichment of chord progressions using a CVAE-LSTM model. The dataset includes both simple chord progressions and their harmonically enriched reharmonizations.

---

## Contents

- `MIDIS/MIDI_TEST/`: MIDI files with original simple chord progressions.
- `MIDIS/MIDI_GENERATED/`: MIDI files with reharmonized and harmonically enriched chord progressions.

---

## Usage

These MIDI files can be used to listen to the original and enriched progressions, or to train and evaluate harmonic generation models.

---

## Code

The source code for model training and evaluation is not currently available. It will be uploaded to this repository upon acceptance of the work.
